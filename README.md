## Whitelist of BlockJane
BlocJane ia a Java Blockchain library created for flexible and fast blockchain development for enterprise needs.


## TODO list
1. Make that when we change some blockchain properties Blockchain save info about nes state and time block of changing state. Also save initial state in blockchain. We need this to make possible validation of all blockchain after chaging properties like consensus, hashing algo, nonce and others.
2. Realize api to add data to new block
4. Write test for invalid chain hashes. When isChainValid method will give error of chain validation.
